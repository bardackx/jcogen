# jcogen
A SAP JCoFunction mapping generator, because it is easier to generate the mapping direcly from the function than to trust the ever changing functional specification document.

## TODO
- Move structure mapping from the function class to the model class (or to a method in the function class at least)
- Unit tests
- Command Line Interface
- Graphic User Interface
- Tutorial
